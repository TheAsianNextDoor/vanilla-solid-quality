# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Mac OS X with:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) Package Manager
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) recommended to manage nodejs version
- [nodejs/npm](https://nodejs.org/tr/download/package-manager/#macos) (run `nvm use` or see .nvmrc for correct version)

## Installation

Install nvm if you don't have it already:

```shell
brew install nvm
```

The node version in the project's .nvmrc file will be the default when calling nvm commands without a version.

```shell
nvm install
nvm use
```

If you're using nvm across multiple repos with different versions it's recommended to set up a deeper shell integration so that when changing into this directory nvm will automatically switch versions. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration)

Install pnpm

```shell
brew install pnpm
```

Then install npm dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install
```

Finally, start the app in development mode:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Your default browser should open the running application at http://localhost:3000

## Scripts

`check-updates` - Checks for updates on all npm modules that don't match the ncurc.json file

`clean` - Removes node_modules and package-lock.json for a clean install

`coverage` - Runs Vitest in coverage mode

`coverage:view` - View the coverage html file for more granular details

`build` - Runs Vitest in build mode and outputs to dist folder

`dev` - Runs Vitest in dev

`fix` - Runs prettier and eslint on repo

`playwright:test` - Runs all playwright files

`playwright:debug-test` - Runs a single playwright file in test mode

`prepare` - Lifecycle hook to prepare husky

`preview` - Builds a production version of app and servers file locally

`test` - Runs Vitest in watch mode

`test:ui` - Opens the Vitest UI test runner

## Developer Tools

### VS Code

`Debug on Chrome` - Launch the project in a chrome instance and allow inline Vscode debugging. This chrome instance's user data profile resides inside this directory - `.vscode/vscode-chrome-debug-userdatadir/`. This ensures a fresh environment to test against and also allows developers to segregate their personal and developer Chrome instance (highly recommend)

`Test and Watch Current File` - Runs Vitest in watch mode on the currently focused file in editor

# Building

Run the build script to output files to the `dist` directory

```shell
pnpm run build
```
